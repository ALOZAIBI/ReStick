### Clip

Cool interactions can happen between items/abilities.
In this example I had the Cloning item on death.
And the character had a few magic abilities. So after the character dies, all the clones fire out a ton of magic.

# Some Features

### Item's change the character's look
Notice how the Sorcerer gets it's look once a magic item is equipped.

And how the tank get it's look once a tank item is equipped

### Displaying Ability Improvements on stat upgrade
When a character levels up we can upgrade it's stats.
I added a feature so that we can see the effect of the stat upgrade to the ability.
